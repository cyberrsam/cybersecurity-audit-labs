# Cybersecurity Audit Case Studies

This repository contains simulated internal IT audits conducted using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## Case Study: Botium Toys Internal Audit

Scope:
Full review of the organisation's security program including assets, access controls, compliance posture and business continuity controls.

Key Findings:
- Lack of encryption for cardholder data (PCI-DSS risk)
- No disaster recovery plan or backups
- Weak access control implementation
- No intrusion detection system (IDS)

Risk Score:
